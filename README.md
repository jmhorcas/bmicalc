# BMI calculator
A biomedical calculator for the body mass index (BMI) and other parameters.

Firstly test for the bmi method are defined. Considering the result of the function bmi 
it is developed the following tests:

1.	For different inputs (mass and height) the result from the function should be equal 
	to the actual bmi and should not be for incorrect bmi (we try this adding 1 to the correct solution)

2.	For different inputs the result from the function cannot be 0. i test this checking that bmi is not equal to 0.

3.	For different inputs the result from the function cannot be negative. I test that checking that bmi/bmi
	is not equal to -1.
