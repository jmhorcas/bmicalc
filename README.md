Check that it takes less than a second to calculate the BMI.

# Test 5
Check the funcionality of the category() method.

# Test 6
Check the funcionality of the category() method by evaluating that are not equals the results and the input.

# Test 7
It throws a RuntimeException when the category is zero or a negative number. because everyone must have a BMI.

# Test 8
Check the funcionality of the abdominalObesity() method by using AssertTrue()

# Test 9
Check the funcionality of the abdominalObesity() method by using AssertFalse()

# Test 10
Check the funcionality of the abdominalObesity() method by using AssertTrue()

# Test 11
Check the funcionality of the abdominalObesity() method by using AssertFalse()

# Test 12
